Please submit your textual answers to the following questions in this file:
- P-3.1

    1. There is the initial password so that you could change the password if you didn't provide any initial password yourself.
    2. So that you could easily get the initial password and change it.

- P-3.14

    All classes were covered when I ran the test suite with coverage. So they all got 100% for methods and lines.
    I would say 0% class coverage is certainly not good and coverage for said classes should be implemented ASAP.

- P-3.15

    It makes errors that would otherwise be difficult to read by a human actually readable in development. This is because
    you can set custom messages for the assertions so you know exactly where to look and what went wrong right away. I tested this with
    activate command by providing it a bad password (check the class to see what error message the assert throws).
