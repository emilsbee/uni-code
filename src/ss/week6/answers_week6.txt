Please submit your textual answers to the following questions in this file:
- P-6.9

    26 * 26 * 26 * 26 is the amount of times it could take max to find the right 4 letter lowercase password.
    Basically for each letter you can pick any letter from the 26 letter english alphabet, hence the 26.

- P-6.11

    I would guess it is because the drawMandel method draws on the height on width provided. Hence, anything that is
    within that space gets overdrawn which in this case is the menu that when opened is above the mandel.

- P-6.12

    When a call is made to mandelDraw() instead of draw() there is no multithreading, hence after starting the drawing
    you can't access the menu during that time. 

- P-6.14

    There is no thread initiated so nothing can be drawn.

- P-6.18

    Problem is that two threads are trying to use the same resources at the same time. This is not ideal as the input for 
    both threads shows up at the same time so its basically impossible to use.

- P-6.20

    Overall everything works as expected except that the printing of results doesn't happen right away but only at the end 
    for both threads. Instead the printing should happen right after the two numbers are entered. 

- P-6.21

    Nothing changes if sum() is made synchronised and that's because the two thread use different instances of TestSyncConsole. So ultimately
    the threads don't access the same sum() method.

- P-6.23

    1) It basically means that threads can enter the lock more than once. 

    2) It is indeed different as the synchronised statement only locks the resource for a thread once without the possiblity to re-enter the lock.


    3) In short ReentrantLock is more flexible. It allows to perform resource locking wihout a block, meaning you could even use a lock between methods. 
    The said flexibility offers a variety of methods which I won't go into but for example the ReentranctLock offers lock polling, thread fairness policy, etc. 

    4) Undoubtedly it is a bit more complicated to use and can be an overkill in situation where a simple synchronisation is needed.  

- P-6.25

    The accessing of buffer by the consumer and producer threads is well basically random. This could be solved by synchronisation.

- P-6.26

    The notifyAll() is preferable because notify() wakes up only one thread which might not be the thread that is needed to woken. Hence, notifyAll() is a safer option.

- P-6.28

    The finall balance in the account isnt always 0.0 because two threads are operating with the same resource without that resource being synchronised.

- P-6.29

    1) The only possible value is 3. This is because both thread a1 and thread a2 operate on the
    same IntCell and they are provided 1,2 as values to add respectively. Important to note that 
    the IntCell starts at 0 so 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

    2) Calling run() doesn't create a new thread. So if a1.start() and a2.start() would be replaced by a1.run() and a2.run(), then no new threads would be created
    but the method run() would still run twice, though on the same one original thread.

    3) The try/catch has to be there because one thread might be interrupted and then the other thread would keep waiting for it to finish although it never would. Hence
    the try/catch has to be implemented. Also, it is not possible to compile if the two .join() aren't in a try/catch block.

    4) The result in this case would be the same. This is because ultimately it doesnt matter in what order (or simultaneously) threads access the the methods since they both are called once 
    and therefore whether you first add 2 then 1 to the value or add 1 and then 2 the result will always be the same.
