    1) In java.lang package
    2) In total there are 15 constructor methods, although 2 are deprecated.
       They mostly differ in the type of charset and byte array they accept.
    3) There is only one String class so there can only be one way to build an instance
       which is using the String keyword.

- P-2.11
    A JUnit test suit runs with 5 tests. If the tests pass they all have green checkmarks
    but otherwise if tests fail there is explanation of what went wrong. For example, the test
    might show what value it expected and what it received. Also, the time it took to execute the test
    is shown in ms.

- P-2.13
    The whole project is included in the JavaDoc. It makes it easy to browse project packages. Within a package
    it is easy to have an overview of various classes it contains. Then within classes, there is quite a detailed
    description of the various methods and properties the class has. It shows the arguments a method receives as
    well as what it returns. Overall, makes it easy to learn about code without going through the code itself.
